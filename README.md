# React Firebase Demo

How to get going quickly

## The process

The project was bootstrapped using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). This gives us a ready to go development environment. 

We then develop our app and can when we're satisified we can `compile` it into static files which we deploy to **firebase** static hosting.

## Live demo

The demo can be found here [react-firebase-demo-e951e.firebaseapp.com](https://react-firebase-demo-e951e.firebaseapp.com/)

## This demo uses the following packages

- [firebase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase)
- [react-bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-bootstrap)
- [bootstrap@3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap)
- [firebase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase)

Please note. [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) handles all **react** dependencies.
